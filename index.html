                    The graph above highlights the most effective drug for the most bacteria in the dataset. The visual encodings I used here are position along a common scale, a small scale, and the opacity and hue of each circle to highlight which drug is the most effective. I chose to use position along a common scale with bubbles because the exact value for each bubble isn’t as important as the underlying question of which bubble has the lowest position (relative to the x-axis) in each column, where each column represents a different bacteria.

                    I used hue because using hue as a perceptual tool is very effective for categorizing nominal data (in this case the three different drug strains). In tandem with hue, I used the opacity of each circle to actually express if that particular circle had the lowest value for its column. The difference between two nearly opaque circles and one completely saturated circle in each column makes it very easy to pick out the saturated circle which is the circle that is intended to be highlighted. A small range of numbers on the y-axis was used for the same

                    reason bubbles were used with position; that is because the exact value of the bubble isn’t as important as knowing if it is the lowest bubble or not. In having all the bubbles on one chart, besides knowing which drug was the most effective for each individual bacteria, you can also see how many bacteria each drug was the most effective on based off how much of each of the three colors you see which is something that would be much harder to get out of staring at tubular data.

                    The graph above shows that gram-negative bacteria will tend to be more antibiotic resistant that gram positive bacteria. The visual encodings I used for this graph are primarily length, grouping (with color), and a small scale. Here, length is used to compare the values of the bacteria in the two different groups. Because of the small scale, you can’t make precise judgements of what the exact length of each bar is, but that isn’t what the graph wants to show. The graph wants to show if the columns in the left have longer bars than

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    the columns in the right, and perceiving length makes this easy  because you can see color in nearly all the columns in the left group and only in several columns in the right group. The use of a smaller range of ‘y’ values was used here because some of the data points are huge outliers and when the y-axis is scaled to see the tops of those bars, you lose visibility of any of the smaller bars. Here, I used color not only to discern between each different drug, but to split the data into two groups.

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    Those groups are bacteria that are gram-negative (the pink), and bacteria that are gram-positive (the purple). Prior to grouping the data by color, I had to sort it by stain. The two color groups are an effective encoding because you can easily see which group has larger bars in each column which can and should be interpreted as a bacteria’s higher resistance to a particular antibiotic. Also from the graph, given the stain of a bacteria, one could predict if an antibiotic of greater strength would be necessary to inhibit that bacteria’s growth.

                    The three graphs above show the effectiveness of each drug on gram stain negative bacteria and gram stain positive bacteria. The encodings I used are length and hue. In pairing with those visual encodings, I also sorted the data on minimum inhibitory concentration level. In these graphs, the color of each bar represents if the bacteria is gram-negative or gram-positive. Because the data was sorted by MIC value and colored by gram stain, you can easily see patterns between the

                    two (e.g. most purple columns have low MIC values) that can be interpreted as the effectiveness of the given drug on a gram stain of bacteria. Like the previous chart, length is used not to show precise values, but to compare the general height of each bar to the rest (higher or lower). This is effective because you can tell which stain a drug was most effective on by how little of one color you see. The ‘y’ scale is

                    small enough so you can still see the color of a bar even if the value is really small but large enough that you can see how drastic the differences are in the bars further communicating the effectiveness of each drug. Based off these graphs it is easy to see that penicillin is effective on gram positive bacteria, whereas streptomycin and neomycin are effective on both gram positive and gram negative bacteria but maybe a little more so gram negative.
